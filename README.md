# LangChain + Google Gemini AI Projects

This repository contains **practical implementations and experiments using LangChain with Google Gemini models**.  
The goal of this project is to understand **prompt engineering, chaining, conversational context, Streamlit apps, and embeddings**, while building real, usable mini-applications.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository includes:

- 🧒 **Kids Story Generator** built with Streamlit  
- 💬 **CLI-based conversational chatbot** with manual memory handling  
- 🔎 **Embedding model experiments** for semantic understanding  
- 🧠 Core LangChain concepts such as:
  - `PromptTemplate`
  - Chains
  - LLM invocation

## ✨ Features

### 1. Kids Story Generator (Streamlit)

A web-based application that generates **creative children’s stories** based on:

- Child’s age  
- Gender  
- Story genre  
- Story length  

#### Highlights
- Uses `PromptTemplate` for structured prompting  
- Chains **Prompt → Gemini model** using LangChain  
- Produces **age-appropriate, engaging stories** with positive morals  

---

### 2. Conversational Chat (Command Line)

A terminal-based chatbot that:

- Stores previous conversation manually  
- Explicitly passes chat history to the model  
- Demonstrates why **LLMs do not remember context automatically**

#### Purpose
- Understand conversation memory limitations  
- Learn how context must be included in prompts  

---

### 3. Embeddings Experiments

Basic experimentation with embedding models to understand:

- Text vector representation  
- Semantic similarity  
- Foundations for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems
